title: Left Rotate Bits of a Number

## Introduction

Given an integer, a rotation is an operation similar to shift operation of bits except that the bits that fall off at one end are put back to the other end. In left rotation, the bits that fall off at left end are put back at right end.

## Explanation

Consider a number `n` = `13` and we have to left rotate the number by `k` = `2` places.

```
The binary equivalent of the number is 1101

The binary equivalent after left rotating by one place, 1101 becomes 1011 (now k = 1)
The binary equivalent after left rotating by one place again, 1011 becomes 0111 (now k = 2)

Since k = 2, we can stop the shift operation now.


The decimal equivalent of 1011 is 8.
```

Hence the number obtained by left rotating `n` = `13`, by `k` = `2` places, is 8.

## Algorithm

Let us assume that the given number be `n` and the number of places to shift be `cnt`,

- Declare `cnt` as `cnt` modulo `31`
- Begin a While loop till `cnt` greater than `0`
  - Set `msb` as the bitwise AND of `n` right shifted by `31`
  - Left rotate `n` by one bit
  - Set `n` as the bitwise OR of `n` and `msb`
  - Decrement the value of `cnt` by 1
- Return `n`

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input

```

Enter the number? 23
How many bits do you want to rotate? 12
```

#### Output

```
The Left-rotated number is: 94208
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity - `O(n)`, where `n` is the given number
- Space complexity - `O(1)`
