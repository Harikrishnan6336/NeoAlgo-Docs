## Introduction

Given two numbers we have to find the number of bits to be flipped to convert one number to another.

## Explanation

Consider two numbers `n1` = `12` and `n2` = `17`

```
Binary equivalent of n1 is 00001100
Binary equivalent of n2 is 00010001

Here, we need to flip the first, third, forth and fifth bits from the LSB of n1 to convert it to n2.
Hence, the number of bits to be flipped to interconvert the given numbers is 4.
```

We need to flip the bits, present in same places in both numbers, that are not the same. We can find such bits by taking an **xor** of the given numbers and counting the number of set bits in them.

## Algorithm

Let us assume that the given two numbers be `n1` and `n2`,

-   Set `val` the value of the xor of the numbers `n1` and `n2`
-   Set `count` a value of `0`
-   Begin a While loop till `val` greater than `0`
    -   Increment the value of `count`
    -   Set `n` the value of `n` bitwise AND `(n - 1)`
-   Return `count`

## Sample Input and Output

#### Input

```
Enter the two numbers: 12 24
```

#### Output

```
Number of bits to be flipped to inter-convert the given numbers is 2
```

## Complexity Analysis

-   Time complexity - `O(log(n))`, where `n` is the greater of the given numbers
-   Space complexity - `O(1)`
